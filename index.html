      <li> Addressing Climate Vulnerability in Nepal Through Resilient Inclusive WASH Systems (RES-WASH)</li>
      <details>
      <summary>Project Details</summary>
        <p>This research aims to improve local expertise on climate resilient, inclusive, and sustainable Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) by producing evidence-based data and information, and ensuring 
          their outreach, accessibility and use by local stakeholders, especially local governments in Dailekh and Sarlahi districts. This evidence and knowledge base will be used to plan, design, and implement 
          approaches to strengthening capacity of key local actors, who can influence the planning, design, and delivery of more inclusive and climate-resilient WASH. The specific objectives are:
          <ol>
            <li>To assess vulnerability of WASH infrastructure and facilities from climatic and non-climatic hazards such as landslides.</li>
            <li>To identify the gendered and social vulnerabilities related to WASH and climate change experienced by diverse groups of women, girls, persons with disabilities and marginalized communities.</li>
            <li>To improve knowledge and capacity for effective WASH systems, programs and institutional mechanisms that are more inclusive and climate resilient.</li>

      <summary>Project Details</summary>
      <p>
       With climate change, concern about water security has been raised among the scientific and policy community. South Asia, where the Water Tower of Asia is located, home
      to the world’s 1/4th population is always under water scarcity. This is exacerbated by climate change and a lack of sufficient water storage infrastructures. In this project, we aim to map the water storage that is
      located in the South Asian countries viz, Nepal, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. A cohort of experts from academia, government, research centers, and like-minded groups is formed to discuss and map
      the potential water storage in each country. By now, we have mapped the surface water storage in each country using a remote sensing approach and are in the process of validation.

       The project aims to evaluate the rainfall extremes to examine the socioenvironmental challenges in the world’s largest man-made reservoir Volta River Basin (VRB) in West
        Africa using the long-term reanalysis data. Results of the research show that decreasing frequency of rainfall events has led to environmental challenges like droughts while the increasing rainfall intensity is
        responsible for flood like environmental issues. Frequent occurrence of the series of floods and drought has led the social issues like poverty (+5%) and water-food insecurity (+15%). The increasing trend of dry
        years and decreasing trend of the wet years is projected to affect the irrigation productivity and the hydropower production. Further, with increase in the dry events in the basin, climate adaptive measures
        need to be addressed to minimize the climate related hazards.

      <li> Assessment of interrelationship between water energy and food using GIS, remote sensing, and simulation models in data sparse region</li>
            <details>
      <summary>Project Details</summary>
      <p>
        The inter relationship among water, energy and food is a key to achieving
        sustainable development goals and addressing the socio-economic-environmental challenges. With the
        increment in the supply of irrigation water, the crop yield is expected to increase by 83% for wheat crop
        and 16.3% for paddy crop at lower Bagmati River Basin (BRB). Similarly, for the upper and mid BRB the
        crop yield increased by 124.4%, and 165.8% for wheat crop respectively. For the paddy, crop yield
        increased by 81.8% and 32.6% for paddy at upper and mid BRB respectively. The revenue generated with
        the sale of energy is estimated to be ranging from 1.4 billion to 72.5 billion NRs while with the sale of the
        yielded crops at the different rate of consumption the revenue generation ranges from 25.8 to 45.2 billion
        NRs. The integration of water-energy-food nexus would be important in developing agricultural and landuse modeling and 
        develop strategies to explore fundamental basin of food & energy supply for sustainable
        future. In addition, an appropriate nexus model would support in deriving balanced water ecosystem under
        different climate scenarios.

      <li> Climate extremes in Babai River Basin using climate models </li>
            <details>
      <summary>Project Details</summary>
      <p>
         The research on climate extremes conducted at Babai River Basin
        (BaRB) for both historical time series (1986-2014) and future time series (2020-2100) using climate models
        from CMIP5 shows that the basin has two major zones regarding the water availability. The East zone is
        having abundant amount of water compared to the West zone. This can raise water conflict within the basin
        and have substantial challenges in managing the water resources among the stakeholders. With the high
        rainfall, the basin received large floods periodically and small floods annually. To minimize the
        consequence of floods in the basin, integration of structural and non-structural adaptive ways is suggested.
        Analysis of monthly low flows (median flow) for both pre-(1990-2000) and post-(2001-2009) impact
        period shows during the high season flow (July – October) flow is more during pre-impact period compared
        to post-impact period resulting environmental issues like flood, landslide, soil erosivity, etc. Result of the
        coefficient of dispersion (CD) shows, for the post impact period the dispersion is higher compared to the
        pre-impact period during the high flow season.

      <p>
        The research is carried out to project the future land use and land cover
        using the land projection model at Pokhara and Dharan in Nepal and estimation of potential groundwater
        Recharge area under climatic and land cover change conditions. The temporal projection showed an
        increasing nature of the agriculture and built-up area, with the reduction of the forest area. The forest area
        is expected to drop to approx. 10000 Ha from 15000 Ha of land. The built-up area was estimated to increase
        by 2000 Ha in 30 years. In the year 2020, the forest was converted to agriculture, which increased in the
        years 2030, 2040, and 2050. Built-up land use type was projected to increase by 16.91% (3760.29 Ha) in
        2030, 33.82% (4304.16 Ha) in 2040 and 50.73% (4848.03 Ha) in 2050. Similarly, the reduction in forests
        were projected to occur by -9.85%, -19.69% and -29.54% in the years 2030, 2040, and 2050, respectively.
        The conversion of land use type from forest to agriculture was more pronounced during 2040 and 2050.
        The increase in the agricultural land in this region was found to occur by +10%, +15.52%, and +17.5% in the
        years 2030, 2040, and 2050 respectively,y with respect to 2020 (current period). Only 10% and 5% of the
        very high groundwater recharge area was found in 2030 and 2040, respectively, in the southern area, whereas
        no areas were projected with very high recharge capacity in 2050 in Pokhara.
